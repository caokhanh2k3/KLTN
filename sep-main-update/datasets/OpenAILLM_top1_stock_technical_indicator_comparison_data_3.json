Give your response in this format:\n(1) Price Movement, which should be either Positive or Negative.\n(2) Explanation, which should be in a single, short paragraph.\nHere are some examples:\nFacts: \n2016-04-24\nMarket anticipation increased ahead of Apple\u2019s Q2 earnings, with analysts warning of weak iPhone demand and possible revenue decline.\nNews outlets speculated that Apple might post its first year-over-year revenue drop in over a decade.\n\n2016-04-25\nApple's stock dipped slightly as investors grew cautious.\nReports emerged that Apple had reduced supplier orders, reinforcing expectations of lower iPhone sales.\n\n2016-04-26\nApple reported its Q2 2016 earnings, missing both profit and revenue estimates.\nApple's revenue for the quarter was $50.56 billion, falling short of the estimated $52 billion.\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.90, lower than the expected $2.00.\nThis marks the first time in 13 years that Apple experienced a quarterly decline in revenue.\niPhone sales experienced a decline for the first time since its debut in 2007.\nThe company's guidance for the next quarter indicates expected sales of $41 billion to $43 billion.\nApple's dividend yield increased to 2.3%.\nCEO Tim Cook attributed the challenges to strong macroeconomic headwinds, especially in China.\nDespite the earnings miss, Apple announced plans to raise its dividend and return $50 billion more to shareholders.\nApple's stock price experienced a decline of around 4.8% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.\n\nTechnical Indicators:\nSMA_5: 101.5  \nEMA_5: 102.2  \nMACD: 1.8  \nMACD_SIGNAL: 1.2  \nMACD_HIST: 0.6  \nRSI: 72  \nBB_UPPER: 110  \nBB_LOWER: 95  \nBB_MIDDLE: 102.5  \nOBV: 1,200,000,000  \nADX: 35  \nDMP: 30  \nDMN: 15  \n\nPrice Movement: Negative\n\nExplanation: Despite strong short-term momentum signals \u2014 such as a positive MACD histogram and a high RSI of 72 \u2014 the market reacted negatively due to fundamental weaknesses revealed in Apple\u2019s Q2 2016 earnings. The high RSI suggested the stock was nearing overbought territory, increasing the likelihood of a correction. Although trend strength was confirmed by a strong ADX reading (35) and bullish directional indicators (DMP > DMN), technicals alone couldn\u2019t overcome investor concerns about slowing iPhone sales, revenue miss, and weak guidance. The OBV, while strong, hinted that recent accumulation may have been driven by misplaced optimism ahead of earnings. The post-earnings sell-off reflected a classic divergence: technicals were bullish, but fundamentals turned bearish. Consequently, the stock fell nearly 5% in after-hours trading, underscoring how disappointing financials and weak outlook can quickly override technical momentum.\n\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\nFacts2022-04-08\n- Amazon $AMZN reportedly plans to appeal its loss to union organizers in New York\n- Real-time trading alerts and global trading community available for various stocks including $AAPL, $TSLA, $AMZN, $BTC.X, $FB, $SPY, $NFLX, $AMD, $MSFT, $AMC, $NVDA, $BABA, $NIO\n- $AMZN Canada Prime subscription prices are set to increase\n- Option plays for $AMZN including a SWEEP for $3000 puts with a significant volume and premium\n- Bull forecasts for $AMZN with a positive change intraday\n- Top flow in the consumer discretionary sector for various stocks including $AMZN\n- Trading activity and performance of various stocks like $AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOGL, $TSLA, $NVDA, $FB, $V, $WMT, $JNJ, $VFC, $DIS, $URBN, $MAR, $IPG, $BWA\n\n(Note: These facts are based on the provided list of tweets and may not cover all key facts regarding AMZN stock)\n\n2022-04-09\nBased on the tweets, key facts regarding AMZN stock include:\n- Amazon is seeking an election re-run due to allegations of New York union organizers distributing marijuana.\n- Potential conflicts between Amazon and Facebook are discussed, with Amazon having strong business models and Facebook being communication-focused.\n- Massive mention counts for other stocks in the last hour, with AMC and Tesla being prominent.\n- Amazon reported earnings before the markets opened.\n- A significant options trade on Amazon, with a $3150.00 Call for Friday, June 17, 2022, amounting to approximately $57 million.\n- Earnings reports for Amazon were expected to be released.\n- Option traders discuss potential upcoming moves in Amazon stock.\n- Updates on Amazon's stock performance and unusual activity.\n- An analyst's recommendation to buy Amazon stock.\n- Amazon signing contracts for low-orbit satellite launches with multiple companies.\n- Amazon mentioned in discussions about financial success and investing, along with other major tech stocks.\n\n2022-04-10\n- Amazon's stock (AMZN) is currently trading around $3089.21, down 2.11%.\n- There are discussions about turning Twitter's headquarters into a homeless shelter involving Bezos, Musk, and Twitter.\n- Traders are advised to visit a specific website for gaining the best trading insights related to stocks like SPY, AMZN, NVDA, and BA.\n- There is speculation about a potential deal between a company called Muln and Amazon, but no confirmation is provided.\n- Amazon labor union workers have demanded contract negotiations with the e-commerce giant.\n- A trading alert service is mentioned, offering updates on stocks like AAPL, TSLA, and AMZN.\n- Amazon's stock price is currently -5.2%, below the 10MA, and has remained stagnant since summer 2020.\n- Amazon's first union of warehouse workers has sent a letter demanding contract negotiations to begin.\n- In the last hour, Amazon (AMZN) was mentioned 22 times on social media platforms.\n- Various stock trends and signals related to Amazon (AMZN) are shared, along with discussions on trading strategies.\n- The company is expected to report earnings shortly, and options for trades are shared.\n- A quarterly plan for stock trading services is priced at $31.99.\n- The focus list includes specific price points for Calls and Puts for companies like Amazon (AMZN), Devan Energy (DVN), and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n2022-04-11\nAmazon (AMZN) has priced a $12.75 billion bond offering, selling a variety of notes due in different years.\nBezos and Musk discussed making Twitter (TWTR) headquarters a homeless shelter.\nStocks like GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, and SHOP are splitting their stocks.\nInflation, supply chain disruptions, war, and higher rates may lead to lower stock prices.\nThere is a focus list for AMZN options trading.\nAmazon is expected to report earnings, and its stock may be volatile.\nAmazon's stock price has been bouncing but could see another leg lower.\nThere have been discussions on borrowing and investing strategy within the tech industry.\nAmazon is holding a jumbo bond deal, in part to fund a $10 billion buyback program.\n\n2022-04-12\nAmazon is reportedly in need of more workers to staff its warehouses.\nHBO Max, owned by Warner Bros.

Reports of Amazon appealing a union loss, possible price increase for Canada Prime subscriptions, and demand for contract negotiations from labor unions could add uncertainty and negatively influence investor sentiment. Concerns about potential conflicts with Facebook, criticism of Amazon's business practices, and the company's need for more warehouse workers could further dampen market confidence in Amazon's future performance. These factors collectively point to a negative price impact on AMZN stock.", "completion_b": "Positive\n\nExplanation: Despite the negative price movement on April 10th, Amazon's stock (AMZN) shows signs of a potential rebound based on technical indicators. The stock is currently trading below its Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating a possible oversold condition. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44.58, suggesting a neutral sentiment and room for upside movement. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and its Signal Line are near convergence, potentially signaling a shift in momentum. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) remains high, indicating continued buying interest despite recent price declines. The Bollinger Bands also show a narrowing of price volatility, hinting at a potential price breakout. These technical signals combined suggest a positive outlook for Amazon's stock price movement in the near term."}]

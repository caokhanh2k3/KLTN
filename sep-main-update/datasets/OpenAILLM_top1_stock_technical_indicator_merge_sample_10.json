Additionally, the discontinuation of more robots in Walmart stores, along with speculation about partnerships with other companies, may have added uncertainty to the stock's outlook. The high volume spike at 15:50 could indicate increased trading activity, possibly driven by the trading chatroom discussion mentioning various stocks, including Walmart (WMT), highlighting it as actively monitored and discussed.

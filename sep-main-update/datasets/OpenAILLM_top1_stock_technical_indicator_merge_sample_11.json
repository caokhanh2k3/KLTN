Give your response in this format:\n(1) Price Movement, which should be either Positive or Negative.\n(2) Explanation, which should be in a single, short paragraph.\nHere are some examples:\nFacts: \n2016-04-24\nMarket anticipation increased ahead of Apple\u2019s Q2 earnings, with analysts warning of weak iPhone demand and possible revenue decline.\nNews outlets speculated that Apple might post its first year-over-year revenue drop in over a decade.\n\n2016-04-25\nApple's stock dipped slightly as investors grew cautious.\nReports emerged that Apple had reduced supplier orders, reinforcing expectations of lower iPhone sales.\n\n2016-04-26\nApple reported its Q2 2016 earnings, missing both profit and revenue estimates.\nApple's revenue for the quarter was $50.56 billion, falling short of the estimated $52 billion.\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.90, lower than the expected $2.00.\nThis marks the first time in 13 years that Apple experienced a quarterly decline in revenue.\niPhone sales experienced a decline for the first time since its debut in 2007.\nThe company's guidance for the next quarter indicates expected sales of $41 billion to $43 billion.\nApple's dividend yield increased to 2.3%.\nCEO Tim Cook attributed the challenges to strong macroeconomic headwinds, especially in China.\nDespite the earnings miss, Apple announced plans to raise its dividend and return $50 billion more to shareholders.\nApple's stock price experienced a decline of around 4.8% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.\n\nTechnical Indicators:\nSMA_5: 101.5  \nEMA_5: 102.2  \nMACD: 1.8  \nMACD_SIGNAL: 1.2  \nMACD_HIST: 0.6  \nRSI: 72  \nBB_UPPER: 110  \nBB_LOWER: 95  \nBB_MIDDLE: 102.5  \nOBV: 1,200,000,000  \nADX: 35  \nDMP: 30  \nDMN: 15  \n\nPrice Movement: Negative\n\nExplanation: Despite strong short-term momentum signals \u2014 such as a positive MACD histogram and a high RSI of 72 \u2014 the market reacted negatively due to fundamental weaknesses revealed in Apple\u2019s Q2 2016 earnings.

the market. Musk's Twitter announcements and polls, coupled with speculation on his tax strategy and the impact on Tesla's stock valuation, led to widespread discussions and fluctuating investor sentiment. Musk's decision to sell Tesla shares, the subsequent declines in Tesla's stock price, and concerns about market manipulation as well as regulatory actions further fueled negative investor reactions.

However, the negative momentum forecasted for June, along with the significant 6.5% drop in stock price on May 15, likely contributed to market unease. Additional factors like the selling of shares by a Virginia house member, the impact of Walmart's earnings miss on discount stores like Costco, and the unusual options activity on COST put options further reinforced negative sentiment. The drastic 11.08% decline in COST stock on May 18, driven by news of price hikes due to inflation concerns, exacerbated the negative movement despite Costco's strong earnings growth. The combination of these factors likely led to the overall negative impact on COST stock price."}

Give your response in this format:\n(1) Price Movement, which should be either Positive or Negative.\n(2) Explanation, which should be in a single, short paragraph.\nHere are some examples:\nFacts: \n2016-04-24\nMarket anticipation increased ahead of Apple\u2019s Q2 earnings, with analysts warning of weak iPhone demand and possible revenue decline.\nNews outlets speculated that Apple might post its first year-over-year revenue drop in over a decade.\n\n2016-04-25\nApple's stock dipped slightly as investors grew cautious.\nReports emerged that Apple had reduced supplier orders, reinforcing expectations of lower iPhone sales.\n\n2016-04-26\nApple reported its Q2 2016 earnings, missing both profit and revenue estimates.\nApple's revenue for the quarter was $50.56 billion, falling short of the estimated $52 billion.\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.90, lower than the expected $2.00.\nThis marks the first time in 13 years that Apple experienced a quarterly decline in revenue.\niPhone sales experienced a decline for the first time since its debut in 2007.\nThe company's guidance for the next quarter indicates expected sales of $41 billion to $43 billion.\nApple's dividend yield increased to 2.3%.\nCEO Tim Cook attributed the challenges to strong macroeconomic headwinds, especially in China.\nDespite the earnings miss, Apple announced plans to raise its dividend and return $50 billion more to shareholders.\nApple's stock price experienced a decline of around 4.8% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.\n\nPrice Movement: Negative\n\nExplanation: In the days leading up to Apple\u2019s Q2 2016 earnings report, investor sentiment turned cautious due to mounting speculation about slowing iPhone demand and weak sales in China. On April 24 and 25, multiple reports and analyst revisions fueled expectations of disappointing financial results. These concerns materialized on April 26 when Apple missed both revenue and profit targets. The company posted its first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years, with iPhone sales dropping for the first time since the product\u2019s launch. Additionally, weak guidance for the next quarter further eroded market confidence. Although Apple attempted to reassure investors by raising its dividend and boosting shareholder returns, these measures were insufficient to offset the negative sentiment. As a result, the stock dropped nearly 5% in after-hours trading, reflecting the market's overall negative reaction to the report and its implications for future growth.\n\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\n\n\nFacts:\n2020-06-12\nChevron Corporation's stock (CVX) experienced a significant decline of -8.3829% at the close of trading.\nCVX was at $89.4000 at 4:00 PM.\nCVX was mentioned alongside various other companies and stock tickers in a tweet.\n\n2020-06-15\nChevron Corporation Common Stock (CVX) experienced a significant decline of -3.2471% in stock price during Monday trading.\nCVX was included in the list of large caps of Monday trading, alongside other companies like Boeing (BA), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and others.\n\nPrice Movement:", "input": "", "output": "Negative\n\nExplanation: The consecutive significant declines in Chevron Corporation's stock price on June 12 and June 15, amidst mentions on social media and inclusion in large cap lists, likely contributed to a negative perception among investors.
